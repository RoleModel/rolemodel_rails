# Editor Config Generator

## What you get

Creates a default [`.editorconfig`](https://editorconfig.org/) file for your project.

Also ensures that a VSCode `extensions.json` config file exists in the project and adds
the [EditorConfig for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig)
extension to it.
