# Semaphore Generator

## What you get

<!-- TODO: fill in the rest of this file -->
* semaphore.yml file to run the relevant CI commands
* heroku-deplyment-commands

This is the basic config needed to use semaphore.

## Note
This config assumes
 - `main` is the base branch
 - `yarn test` is the command to run JS tests
