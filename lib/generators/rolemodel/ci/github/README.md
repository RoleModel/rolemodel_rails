# Github Actions Generator

## What you get

* rspec.yml file to run the relevant CI commands
* jest.yml file to run the relevant CI commands

This is the basic config needed to use github actions.

## Note
This config assumes
 - `main` is the base branch
 - `yarn test` is the command to run JS tests
