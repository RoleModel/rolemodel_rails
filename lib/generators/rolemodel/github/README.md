# Github Generator

## What you get

### Pull Request Template

When you open a Pull Request in Github it will use the Markdown file as a [template](./templates/pull_request_template.md) for the content of the PR.

Helpful for reminding collaborators to add specific details to the PR.

### Copilot Instructions

Installed into `.github/instructions`, these are context-specific instructions for Copilot to help it give more accurate
and relevant results. These are a good starting point but they should be tweaked for your project's frameworks and
standards.
