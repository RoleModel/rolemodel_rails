# Lograge Generator

## What you get

### Lograge

Installs [Lograge](https://github.com/roidrage/lograge).

Lograge is an opinionated gem that slims down the amount of logs that Rails generates, with the goal of reducing
noise that's handled by other services. For instance, it removes view rendering logs, which is a duplication of Skylight.
