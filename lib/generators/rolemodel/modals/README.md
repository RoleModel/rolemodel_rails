# Modal and Panel Generator

## What you get

* Custom confirm dialogs via `@rolemodel/turbo-confirm` integration
* Modal and panel styling ..via `@rolemodel/optics` integration
* Modal and panel layouts w/ link helpers (or you could just, e.g. `link_to ... data: {turbo_frame: 'modal'}`)
* frame-missing handler (required for turbo-rails v1.4.0 and above)
* a very simple stimulus controller `toggle` to help with modal/panel animations.

## Turbo confirm example

```slim
  = button_to "Test Confirm", model, method: :delete, data: { \
    turbo_confirm: "For real?!?",
    confirm_details: "You're about to delete #{model.name}, forever. ðŸ˜±",
    confirm_button: "YOLO!",
  }
```

data attributes other than `turbo-confirm` are optional.  See [turbo-confirm](https://github.com/RoleModel/turbo-confirm) for more details.

## Modal & Panel examples

Modal: (the following 2 examples are equivalent)

* `= link_to 'Modal Test', some_modal_layout_action_path, data: { turbo_frame: 'modal' }`
* `= modal_link_to 'Modal Test', some_modal_layout_action_path`

Panel: (the following 2 examples are equivalent)

* `= link_to 'Panel Test', some_panel_layout_action_path, data: { turbo_frame: 'panel' }`
* `= panel_link_to 'Panel Test', some_panel_layout_action_path`

You'll then need to pass the `layout` kwarg when calling `render` with either `modal` or `panel`, depending on which frame is being targeted.  (We recommend against the `layout` controller class method, because it causes *layout fallback* issues when the controller is subclassed.)

e.g.

```ruby
class SomethingsController < ApplicationController
  def new
    render layout: 'modal'
  end
end
```

## TurboFrame modal & panel forms

There are a couple of important rules when it comes to TurboFrames & forms.

1. In the case of errors, your controller action must respond with `status: :unprocessable_entity` *HTTP status code __422__* in order to re-render your form w/ errors.  This is both a Turbo requirement, as well as the mechanism which prevents the modal or panel from re-animating in.
2. In the case of success, your controller action must redirect.  This is a Turbo requirement in Rails 7+

e.g.

```ruby
class SomethingsController < ApplicationController
  def new
    @something = authorize Something.new
    render layout: 'modal'
  end

  def create
    @something = authorize Something.new(some_params)

    if @something.save
      redirect_to @something, notice: 'Something created successfully'
    else
      render :new, status: :unprocessable_entity, layout: 'modal'
    end
  end
end
```

## Layout Content Slots

The included modal layout includes *slots* for title content & submit buttons, in addition to the main content `yield`.  If you're use case is simpler, you may remove these sections.  Otherwise, the following is an example edit template meant to be rendered in the modal layout.

```slim
= content_for :modal_title do
  h2 Edit the thing

= content_for :modal_actions do
  = button_tag 'Save', class: 'btn btn--primary', form: dom_id(@thing, :edit)

= simple_form_for @thing do |f|
  = f.input :name
  = f.input :description
```

__note:__ the submit button in the `new.html.slim` version of this template would be `form: dom_id(@thing)` or simply `form: 'new_thing'`.  For further explanation of form Id generation, see the [polymorphic_path docs](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionDispatch/Routing/PolymorphicRoutes.html) of simply inspect the form element in your browser.
