Slim is used for HTML templating, and it should be used to create clean and efficient views.

## CSS Library
- Use the [RoleModel/optics](https://github.com/RoleModel/optics) library for styling when possible.

Do not use any other CSS libraries or frameworks unless explicitly stated in the project requirements.
Avoid Tailwind CSS or similar utility-first frameworks.
